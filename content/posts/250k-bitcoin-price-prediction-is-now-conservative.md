Major Bitcoin (BTC) bull Tim Draper now thinks that his own prediction that BTC price will hit $250,000 by 2022 may be understating the power of Bitcoin.

BTC price to grow with adoption
-------------------------------

In an interview with crypto news network Blocktv on Sept. 13, the famous American venture capital investor has once again expressed his bullish stance to Bitcoin, forecasting the soon-to-come mass global adoption that will push the price of Bitcoin higher and higher.

Draper stated in the interview:

> "$250,000 means that Bitcoin would then have about a 5% market share of the currency world and I think that maybe understating the power of Bitcoin."

Bitcoin still too complex 
--------------------------

According to Draper, people are still preferring fiat money over Bitcoin so far because fiat money seems to be an easier option to pay for services. The VC billionaire argued that Bitcoin’s lack of ease of use is the main impediment of the cryptocurrency to the mass adoption to date, claiming that “engineers have not made it that easy enough for everyone to use Bitcoin.”

However, in the longer term, people will have Bitcoin as the currency of choice because fiat currencies are subject to political influence due to its centralized nature and they will depreciate in value due to a natural inflation rate, Draper said.

He also reiterated his stance that Argentina will be a great market for Bitcoin as a number of local entrepreneurs tend to lose their fortune in local fiat currency due to currency manipulation and devaluation.

Still, even in countries such as the United States, people will generally want a currency that is trusted and decentralised over a currency controlled by entities like the Federal Reserve, which can be very political, Draper concluded.

Draper’s new claims follow his recent forecast that there might be a slight delay in Bitcoin’s path to a $250,000 price.
