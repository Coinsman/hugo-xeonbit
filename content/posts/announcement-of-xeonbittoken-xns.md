What is an IEO?
---------------

An Initial Exchange Offering, is conducted on the platform of a cryptocurrency exchange. Contrary to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), an IEO is administered by a crypto exchange on behalf of the entity that seeks to raise funds with its newly issued tokens.

As the token sale is conducted on the crypto exchange’s platform, token issuers have to pay a listing fee along with a percentage of the tokens sold during the IEO. In return, the tokens are sold on the exchange’s platforms, and their coins are listed after the IEO is over allowing participants to trade their tokens if they want.

**How to participate?**

Participants have to create an account on the exchange’s platform where the IEO is conducted. The contributors then fund their exchange wallets with coins and use those funds to buy the fundraising company’s tokens.
