France is apparently seeing a surge in cryptocurrency adoption. In late September, over 25,000 points-of-sale of 30 French retailers had been installed. Including sportswear giant Decathlon and cosmetics store Sephora will start accepting BTC payments by early 2020. As earlier in September, the French unit of Domino's Pizza launched an ordering competition with a prize of $110,000 in Bitcoin or cash.

On Sept 12, French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire claimed that French authorities do not plan to tax crypto-to-crypto trades. Rather will consider taxation when crypto is sold for fiat money.

> The acceptance of cryptocurrencies is a real challenge for retailers. We are aware of the expectations of the public and the scope of the message we send to a whole community. We are happy to be able to make this ecosystem more concrete for consumers and to enter the crypto-economy in a legal framework.
