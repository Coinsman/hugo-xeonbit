There are some question asking about balance not showing after transactions had been confirmed. After few days doing research we found out that just need to adjust the Wallet creation height in Settings area Click on click to change and change the number to 200000 to resync the wallet from block 200,000 or when block you had create wallet, you also can set from block 0 it may take more time.
