**What is Binance DEX and Binance Chain?**

The **DEX** (**D**ecentralize **EX**change) sounds too good to be true, and many see that as proof that it is not true. However, it might as well be, as **Binance** seems to be aware of what its users want and need. The launch of a **DEX** would make **Binance** a community, more than a simple exchange, and it would guarantee its relevance in the future of crypto.

**What is XNS proposal?**

Recently Xeonbit Token XNS had been submitted their issue [XNS asset](https://explorer.binance.org/asset/XNS-760) and [listing proposal](https://explorer.binance.org/tx/4CCB83FFC6A1440D5508F3EE3458381CC849253941BCCC4A3B13041D18F1A9A7) on Binance Chain.
